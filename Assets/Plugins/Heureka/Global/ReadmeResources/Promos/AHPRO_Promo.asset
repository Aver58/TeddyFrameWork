  Description: 'Asset Hunter PRO is THE project cleaning tool of the asset store.
    It will help you locate all the unused asset and delete them. It will reduce time
    spend waiting for the editor to load. It also simply boosts productivity in general
    by having to search through less stuff.


    Its based on the learnings from Asset Hunter 2, but its a full rewrite with new
    features, new UI, improved workflow and HUGE performance gains.


    Asset Hunter can also aid you in finding those pesky assets that bloat your buildsize
    by giving you a sortable list of used assets.


    Asset Hunter PRO will be released early January 2019 and will be a free update
    for user who purchased Asset Hunter 2 within the last 6 months. Older users wont
    have to pay full price, but can upgrade by paying an upgrade fee.'
