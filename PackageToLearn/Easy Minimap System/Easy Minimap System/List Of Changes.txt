	  CHANGELOG
/////////////////////

v2.4.1
	- Now the officially supported minimum version is Unity 2019.4 or higher. Support for this version of Unity or
	  higher will make it possible to add different new features and improvements in the future. This change also aims
	  to ensure that the tool can always have mature, stable and continuous update support!

v2.4.0
	- Support for local multiplayer split-screen games (which use two Minimap Renderers) has been improved in the backend
	  of the Minimap Renderer component.
	- A demo scene has been added that simulates a split-screen local multiplayer game.
	- The "Minimap Fog" component has been added! The Easy Minimap System now supports Fogs of War! The "Minimap Fog"
	  component will display a fog on your Minimap. It will be possible to reveal what's under the fog only where the
	  player is, but it will also be possible to reveal all the places the player has walked in! You can also reveal
	  locations near other Transforms that are not a player.
	- A demo scene has been added, which shows how Fog of War works.
	- Documentation has been updated to contain the new changes.

v2.3.1
	- A new C# API (based on events) has been added, so that Minimap Renderers can now receive incoming events from the
	  player. The Events that Minimap Renderers can recognize are the Click, Over events and Drag events. Using these
	  events you can add your own logic so that the player can interact with the Minimap of your game, for example,
	  marking or selecting points on a map and so on. The C# API automatically translates the point where the player
	  interacted, and returns the position in the world, to which the player interacted. You can use this for Full Screen
	  Minimap Renderers too.
	- The TPS/FPS demo scene now also uses the new Minimap Renderers C# API to show you an example of using this cool
	  new API!
	- Fixed a small bug with the highlight of Minimap Items, on the border/highlight of a Minimap Renderer/Compass.
	- Now the Minimap Renderer/Compass components can warn you if you find any incorrect settings on your Canvas.
	- Now scans made with Minimap Scanners will be rendered so that they are as far back as possible. This can prevent
	  some rendering unforeseen events, which are very rare, but which were possible.
	- Improved rendering time for Minimap Items that were created at Runtime. This is not an optimization, but they should
	  now appear instantly whenever created at Runtime, instead of appearing after a few milliseconds.
	- Now Minimap Line does not work with just another GameObject to connect, forming a line. Now you can provide a Vector3
	  array of positions to customize your Minimap Line as much as possible.
	- It is now possible to deactivate or temporarily activate existing Waypoints. Deactivated Waypoints will NEVER be
	  considered as possible paths in Route calculations, that is, you can deactivate Waypoints of streets that have
	  obstructions (such as broken bridges, traffic blocks, etc). If the player is on a street that has a block, for
	  example, Minimap Routes will search for another route to the destination, a route that does not pass on the street
	  that has that block.
	- The GPS demonstration scene has been updated to contain some obstructions, to demonstrate the deactivation or
	  activation of Waypoints.
	- The Minimap Routes component has gained new methods for its C# API. These methods are used to manipulate Waypoints
	  at runtime. Consult the documentation for more details.
	- Now Minimap Routes will try to trace a route even if there is no Waypoint near the player/destination and at a height
	  similar to the player/destination.
	- Now Minimap Routes will display a Gizmo that will represent the variable "startingHeightTolerance" in Destination
	  and Starting Transforms.
	- The documentation has been updated to include new tips, instructions and new changes.

v2.2.0
	- The feature of realtime capturing the scene in 3D (on the Minimap Camera) has been brought up again. Now with some
	  additional parameters. This can be useful for games in which the scenario constantly changes, making the use of a
	  Minimap Scanner impracticable.
	- The documentation has been updated to include the new change.

v2.1.1
	- The components have been rearranged in the Inspector's "Add Component" menu.

v2.1.0
	** WARNING **
	  This is a major update. Many C# API methods and variables of the Easy Minimap System components have been renamed,
	  changed or removed. The rendering scale method and how some components work have also changed slightly.
	  If you are already an Easy Minimap System user, it is highly recommended that you make a backup of your project,
	  before proceeding with this update.
	  * Additional note: If you are already an Easy Minimap System user and want to upgrade to this version, you may need
	  to delete the Minimap Renderer components in your scenes (and the GameObjects children of these Minimap Renderers)
	  and then add the new Minimap Renderers however you like. This is necessary because the new Minimap Renderer code
	  is more modern and has several new functions, so it is not compatible with the old Minimap Renderer code.
	*************
	- 
	- All components of the Easy Minimap System have been updated to support the workflow where it is possible
	  to add all components at run time, without any problems. This was possible before, but now it is even easier.
	- Now the Minimap Camera component no longer needs to be activated when it is added to a GameObject.
	- The update system for mini-map items has been updated. You should now notice greater fidelity and optimization
	  as items on the minimap are created, destroyed, activated, deactivated or updated.
	- The scripts for the entire Easy Minimap System have undergone revisions where several have been rewritten from
	  scratch, adapted or reorganized.
	- Some interfaces for some components have undergone minor updates.
	- Minimap Renderer now has a C# API with checkers and methods to further facilitate the handling of Minimap
	  Items featured in the "Minimap Renderer" component. The new API allows you to add, remove or verify that a Minimap
	  Item already exists, with just 1 line of code. You can still manipulate the list of featured Minimap Items easily
	  through the component's UI.
	- The option to display the field of view of a Minimap Item has been removed to bring further optimization to the system.
	- Now the "Minimap Item" components will no longer display an additional Gizmo just above the pivot of their respective
	  GameObject. This will help to reduce visual pollution, will bring a little optimization to the Editor and the
	  component itself, when executed in the Editor.
	- The "Minimap Scanner" component can now be added at run time and scanning can also be performed at run time! You
	  can scan areas or update the existing scan easily via the component's C# API.
	- In this update, making the system as a whole even easier to use was a focus.
	- Now "Minimap Renderer" will no longer create a hierarchy of necessary GameObjects, as soon as you add this component
	  to your scene, in the Editor.
	- Minor improvements and optimization of the algorithm for updating the border icons (highlighted) of the Minimap Renderer.
	- Now, for the minimap items highlighted at the edge of the Minimap Renderer to be displayed correctly, it is no longer
	  necessary for the associated Minimap Camera to have to be rotated at zero on the X axis.
	- Fixed a bug that caused Minimap Items removed from Minimap Items For Highlight in a Minimap Renderer component,
	  not to be disabled from the border of the Minimap.
	- Minimap Camera now has more capture resolutions, increasing the rendering quality of maps that occupy the entire screen.
	- Fixed a bug that caused some of the high resolution scans made on the "Minimap Scanner" components to not be correctly
	  saved and loaded by the components, when scanned through the Editor.
	- New area sizes, power of two (2, 4, 16...) have been added to the Minimap Scanner. This should make it easier for games
	  that use chunks or similar systems to be able to frequently update certain Minimap Scanners at run time, without major
	  performance losses.
	- The "Minimap Item" component now allows you to change the size of an item separately in height or width. This allows
	  a wider range of images/sprites to be used to be rendered on the minimap.
	- The rendering scale of the Sprites in the Minimap Item has been changed to Units (Meters), for better adjustments and
	  scaling of your sprites in the Minimap. You may need to re-adjust all rendering scales for your Minimap Items in
	  your project.
	- Now the minimap components will ALWAYS follow the GameObjects they are on.
	- You can now provide another GameObject for a particular minimap item to follow its rotation, instead of just following
	  the GameObject rotation in which the minimap item is.
	- All components of the Easy Minimap System have been adjusted so that they are completely usable and can be added at runtime.
	- The "Minimap Line" component was added to the system. You can now render lines on the minimap in the positions you prefer!
	- The welcome message has been changed and the top menu has also undergone some changes.
	- A new component has been added to the Easy Minimap System. The new component is "Minimap Routes" and this component is
	  capable of displaying routes in real time (such as GPS) and you can display routes from point A to point B from anywhere
	  on your map. You just need to show Minimap Routes where the streets and paths of your world are through Waypoints and
	  Minimap Routes offers an easy, self-explanatory and functional interface for you to create all Waypoints. You can even
	  create routes that start from your player and go anywhere on the map.
	- Now, each component of the Easy Minimap System has a public method so that you can get all the same components in the scene.
	  For example, you can access a Minimap Item component and call the "GetListOfAllMinimapItemsInThisScene()" method to
	  obtain a complete list containing all Minimap Items in the scene in question.
	- Now the Easy Minimap System has a global and static multiplier to which you can change the value and change the size of all
	  items being rendered on the Minimap in an easy and fast way so that you have even more control. This can be very useful
	  in scenarios where you want to make a global zoom or minimap system in your application. (This global multiplier only applies
	  to components that have a size variable such as Minimap Item, Minimap Line, Minimap Routes and etc...)
	- Minimap Items that are highlighted in a Minimap Renderer component can now rotate in a square format, not just a circular
	  shape as before. This goes for the north icon as well.
	- It is now possible to disable the rendering of the content of a Minimap Renderer.
	- You can now provide a Sprite that will serve as a Foreground for your Minimap Renderer.
	- A new component called "Minimap Compass" has been added. This component renders a horizontal compass system as in some
	  RPG/FPS games.
	- More optimizations were made in codes that run in several frames, in each component of the system.
	- The system documentation has been updated to support all new changes and functionality.
	- It is now possible to also customize the size of Minimap Items when they are displayed prominently in a Minimap Renderer
	  or Minimap Compass.
	- A method has been added to make it possible to check whether a particular Minimap Item, Minimap Line etc, is currently
	  visible to a Minimap Camera or not.
	- Now the Minimap Items highlighted also followed the rotation of the Minimap Items displayed inside the minimap (flipX
	  or flipY).
	- Now, Minimap Renderer allows you to disable Minimap content, change the Minimap Background or Foreground image, in addition
	  to other customizations so that you can further style your Minimap! For example, when defining a Background sprite for your
	  Minimap, you avoid that when the Player reaches the limits of your map, he sees the transparent part of the Minimap!
	- Now the icons highlighted in a Minimap Renderer can rotate in different formats, such as square, circle, rectangle and even
	  ellipse!
	- Minimap Renderer will now display a warning if the format of your Minimap Renderer is not compatible with the Capture format
	  of your Minimap Camera, to help avoid distortions in the display of the Minimap.
	- The documentation has been completely redone and updated as well. Now the new documentation is more modern
	  and more beautiful, it can be found in the folder "_Documentation/Documentation.html" and you can open it
	  directly from within your Unity Editor. If your project still has the old "Documentation.zip" file, you can
	  delete it without any problems.
	- The Minimap Item now displays a Gizmo that shows the area it will occupy (in the world) when displayed on the Minimap.
	- Now, the gizmo that displays the field of view of the "Minimap Camera" component rotates along with the GameObject to which
	  it is following the rotation.
	- The "Minimap Scanner" component now allows you to select a scanning height. This makes it possible for you to do cave scans
	  below zero coordinate or even structures that are in higher positions.
	- The "Minimap Scanner" component now allows you to provide your own scanning texture more easily.
	- The "Minimap Scanner" component now renders (only in the Editor) the area that it will capture during scanning, in addition
	  to a scan height display.
	- Some fields that were used only for internal codes, but which were not used for external scripts, were hidden
	  to avoid confusion.

v1.3.4
	- Fixed a bug that caused some scripts of some Easy Minimap System components to not be compiled in 2020.1
	  versions of Unity, or newer.

v1.3.3
	- Correction of small bugs.
	- There's more to come, soon!

v1.3.2
	- A bug has been fixed that caused the automatic deactivation of some scripts' Gizmos to stop working.
	- Fixed a bug where changing some UI components parameters did not work on some versions of Unity
	  2019.3.x.

v1.3.1
	- The Minimap Camera component now works only after the camera is active. This will avoid rendering
	  problems when instantiating this component, at run time.
	- Fixed an issue that generated log errors on the console, if you left a Minimap Camera not yet
	  activated, in a Minimap Renderer with items registered for highlights.
	- Now, if a minimap item is destroyed, you will no longer see any error messages and the icon will
	  no longer be rendered on your minimap either.
	- Now even if your minimap item is a child of another GameObject and you disable the parent
	  GameObject, the item will also disappear from the minimap.
	- Fixed a bug that caused textures resulting from scanning to have a border for repetition.
	- Now you can create the comp components Minimap Camera, Minimap Text and etc., using the right mouse button!
	- Now disabling a GameObject that contains a Minimap Item highlighted in the Minimap Renderer, or disabling
	  its parent GameObject, will also cause the item to disappear from the Minimap.
	- To avoid problems, Minimap Renderer will no longer accept a Minimap Camera that has not yet enabled.
	- It is no longer necessary to save to view changes to the scene after creating a Minimap Renderer.

v1.2.2
	- The documentation has been updated to ensure greater clarity, volume of information, tips and minor corrections!

v1.2.1
	- Following the rhythm of Unity Engine versions and to guarantee the good permanent support of this asset,
	  now the minimum recommended version is 2018.1, however, you can still use this asset in the 2017.4 LTS
	  version if you prefer. This will allow this asset to always have the latest features and better and
	  more effective support!

v1.2.0
	- All resources, persistent asset data and other files are now saved in "MT Assets/_AssetsData".
	  This makes it easy to manage all files generated by MT assets and if you need to remove any asset,
	  just delete the asset folder. So, even if you want to remove some MT assets from your project, or
	  update it, you will not lose any files or information that you would like to keep!
	- Small improvements have been made to the component interface.

v1.1.1
	- Fixed a bug that caused the compilation or loading time of the scene execution to increase considerably
	  in the editor.

v1.1.0
	- Fixed a bug when importing this asset for the first time, where a file error message was displayed.
	  It was more common with Windows 10 users.
	- Minor corrections in the demo scene.
	- Lists have also been enhanced in the inspector.
	- There was a slight change in the asset API. Now, to access the API methods of this asset,
	  use "using MTAssets.EasyMinimapSystem".

v1.0.0
	- The Easy Minimap System has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
